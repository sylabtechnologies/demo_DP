/*
Amazon wants to develop a more efficient way of evaluating their top N competitors for the latest
Echo device (Alexa-enabled voice assistant). For this analysis, Amazon has developed an
automated web crawler that identifies websites where users have written reviews about
Amazon's competitors. To get a sense of the different competitors out there, Amazon wants to
review these websites to see how often a competitor is mentioned i.e. a competitor is considered
to be a strong competitor if its name occurs in more unique reviews.
Write an algorithm to help Amazon identify the top N competitors mentioned online

Input
The input to the function/method consists of five arguments -
numCompetitors, an integer representing the number of competitors for the Echo device;
topNCompetitors, is an integer representing the maximum number of competitors that Amazon
wants to identify;
competitors, a list of strings representing the competitors;
numReviews, an integer representing the number of reviews from different websites that are
identified by the automated webcrawler;
reviews, a list of strings where each element is a string that consists of space-separated words
representing user reviews.

Output
Return a list of strings representing Amazonsâ€™ top N competitors in order of most frequently
mentioned to least frequent.
